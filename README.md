The Goal of this project is to utilize Google Colab and pyspark environment for big data. We also used Amazon's cloud data service, AWS, to store our data in SQL. The Amazon wireless review data set was used to determine if Vine promo increased reviews.

There was a total of 30,765 5-star reviews. Vine 5-star reviews totaled 222 while non vine 5-star reviews totaled 30,543.

### Review Ratios
Overall, 5-star reviews had a percentage of almost 47%. Vine star reviews had a percentage of 36% and non Vine reviews had a percentage of 47%.

## Sumary
Vine star reviews only totaled less than 1% of all reviews. This is a very small ratio and raises questions about Vine promo on reviews. Ideally this ratio would be significantly higher. Looking at the data on hand one can assume there isnâ€™t a positive basis with Vine program and reviews. 5-star Vine reviews only totaled 36% while non Vine reviews totaled 47%. The results might be different when looking at other review data sets or categories.
